# Mante's custom dimensions
Here I'm going to show all fun Minecraft custom dimensions that I make. The custom dimension option was introduced in snapshot 20w21a and the ability to add them using datapacks was introduced in 1.16 Pre-Release 1. This allows so much fun stuff!

## Shatterboard
Shatterboard is a Checkerboard type world with a scale of 0. It has got a unique feature though: if the "size_horizontal" value in a world's noise parameters is set to 3, each chunk will be cut from the edges, making the world appear shattered, hence why I named it like that. Since the scale is 0, each separated chunk is going to be a different biome which could be a pretty interesting concept or a challenge! This world has every biome in the game, though there are still the 3 vanilla dimensions.
